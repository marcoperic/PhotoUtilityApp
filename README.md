# CHANGES FOR THIS BRANCH

- Delete all button
- Sort the items on the trash screen by most to least similar images found
- Ensure that there are no duplicates returned in the similarity search
- Implement the large picture display with little images preview. There should be a detailed modal when the picture is clicked. If a small preview image is clicked, then the modal will appear and it will highlight the clicked image.
- Ensure that all images on the trash screen are selected and marked for deletion

# Design Notes

When the user swipes to delete an image, the URI is passed to the server and it returns the number of images that are within a certain distance. The original picture is added to the delete page and the neighbor images are also added. The number is displayed as a little pop-up, like a game point number.

The trash screen needs to have a feature that allows users to delete. There also needs to be a modal so that users can closely inspect the images that are going to be deleted.

Track statistics on the profile screen

Need to get a color palette and begin a branch for UI refinement

## IAP

IAP monetization - referrals for content creators?

Limit for non-premium users to 10 swipes per day.

Premium users get unlimited swipes and can also select the threshold for how similar images need to be to be deleted.

On the trash screen, show the number of similar images that are going to be deleted, but limit it to 3 and blur the rest out. Premium membership required.

# Welcome to your new ignited app!

## The latest and greatest boilerplate for Infinite Red opinions

This is the boilerplate that [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red) uses as a way to test bleeding-edge changes to our React Native stack.

Currently includes:

- React Native
- React Navigation
- MobX State Tree
- TypeScript
- And more!

## Quick Start

The Ignite boilerplate project's structure will look similar to this:

```
ignite-project
├── app
│   ├── components
│   ├── config
│   ├── i18n
│   ├── models
│   ├── navigators
│   ├── screens
│   ├── services
│   ├── theme
│   ├── utils
│   └── app.tsx
├── assets
│   ├── icons
│   └── images
├── test
│   ├── __snapshots__
│   ├── mockFile.ts
│   └── setup.ts
├── README.md
├── android
│   ├── app
│   ├── build.gradle
│   ├── gradle
│   ├── gradle.properties
│   ├── gradlew
│   ├── gradlew.bat
│   ├── keystores
│   └── settings.gradle
├── ignite
│   └── templates
|       |── app-icon
│       ├── component
│       ├── model
│       ├── navigator
│       └── screen
├── index.js

│   ├── IgniteProject
│   ├── IgniteProject-tvOS
│   ├── IgniteProject-tvOSTests
│   ├── IgniteProject.xcodeproj
│   └── IgniteProjectTests
├── .env
└── package.json

```

### ./app directory

Included in an Ignite boilerplate project is the `app` directory. This is a directory you would normally have to create when using vanilla React Native.

The inside of the `app` directory looks similar to the following:

```
app
├── components
├── config
├── i18n
├── models
├── navigators
├── screens
├── services
├── theme
├── utils
└── app.tsx
```

**components**
This is where your reusable components live which help you build your screens.

**i18n**
This is where your translations will live if you are using `react-native-i18n`.

**models**
This is where your app's models will live. Each model has a directory which will contain the `mobx-state-tree` model file, test file, and any other supporting files like actions, types, etc.

**navigators**
This is where your `react-navigation` navigators will live.

**screens**
This is where your screen components will live. A screen is a React component which will take up the entire screen and be part of the navigation hierarchy. Each screen will have a directory containing the `.tsx` file, along with any assets or other helper files.

**services**
Any services that interface with the outside world will live here (think REST APIs, Push Notifications, etc.).

**theme**
Here lives the theme for your application, including spacing, colors, and typography.

**utils**
This is a great place to put miscellaneous helpers and utilities. Things like date helpers, formatters, etc. are often found here. However, it should only be used for things that are truly shared across your application. If a helper or utility is only used by a specific component or model, consider co-locating your helper with that component or model.

**app.tsx** This is the entry point to your app. This is where you will find the main App component which renders the rest of the application.

### ./assets directory

This directory is designed to organize and store various assets, making it easy for you to manage and use them in your application. The assets are further categorized into subdirectories, including `icons` and `images`:

```
assets
├── icons
└── images
```

**icons**
This is where your icon assets will live. These icons can be used for buttons, navigation elements, or any other UI components. The recommended format for icons is PNG, but other formats can be used as well.

Ignite comes with a built-in `Icon` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/Components-Icon.md).

**images**
This is where your images will live, such as background images, logos, or any other graphics. You can use various formats such as PNG, JPEG, or GIF for your images.

Another valuable built-in component within Ignite is the `AutoImage` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/Components-AutoImage.md).

How to use your `icon` or `image` assets:

```
import { Image } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Image source={require('../assets/images/my_image.png')} />
  );
};
```

### ./ignite directory

The `ignite` directory stores all things Ignite, including CLI and boilerplate items. Here you will find templates you can customize to help you get started with React Native.

### ./test directory

This directory will hold your Jest configs and mocks.
